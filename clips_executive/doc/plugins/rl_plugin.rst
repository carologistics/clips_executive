===================== ============= =============================================

This plugin provides interfaces used in reinforcement learning based action selection to either access information from the CLIPS environment or to communicate a selected action to the reinforcement learning plugin. In the table above, the type specifies which part of the ROS 2 communication is implemented, if the user wants to use these interfaces, the corresponding counterpart needs to be used (Service <-> Client, Action Server <-> Action Client).

It is intended to use this plugin together with the cxrl_gym environment which serves as a base class in python implementing the counterparts to the interfaces specified here and most of the basic gym-functions (step, reset, action_mask, ...) used in (maskable action) reinforcement learning.

Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~

In the following each interface is presented and explained:

:`create_rl_env_state`:
  
  Type
    Service
  Description
    Creates a string containing all asserted rl-observation facts which have to be asserted by the user by overriding rl-generate-observation function. Format: {"OBSERVATION_1_NAME(PARAM_1,PARAM_2,...)", ...}
  Specification
    .. code-block:: lisp

        ---
        string state

:`get_observable_objects`:
  
  Type
    Service
  Description
    Returns string list of all objects set to be observable by the user (asserted rl-observable-predicate fact) and matching a given type. If there does not exist an object for the type, "Not found" is returned.
  Specification
    .. code-block:: lisp

        string type
        ---
        string[] objects

:`get_observable_predicates`:
  
  Type
    Service
  Description
    Returns information on all predicates set to be observable by the user (asserted rl-observable-predicate fact). ``predicatenames`` lists all the names. ``paramcounts`` specifies for every predicate name with the same index how many parameters the predicate features. ``paramnames`` and ``paramtypes`` list the names and types of all predicates where thee name and type share the same index and both lists are constructed in a way that the first paramcounts[0] entries in both lists are the parameters of predicate predicatenames[0] and so on.
  Specification
    .. code-block:: lisp

        ---
        string[] predicatenames
        uint8[] paramcounts
        string[] paramnames
        string[] paramtypes

:`get_predfined_observables`:
  
  Type
    Service
  Description
    Returns a list of all observation space entries which have been pre-defined (not defined using combinations of observable predicates and observable objects) which are asserted as rl-predefined-observable fact.
  Specification
    .. code-block:: lisp

        ---
        string[] observables

:`get_action_list`:
  
  Type
    Service
  Description
    Returns a list of ids and names of all existing rl-action facts i.e. all executable actions. Format: "actionid|actionname".
  Specification
    .. code-block:: lisp

        ---
        string[] actions

:`get_action_list_robot`:
  
  Type
    Service
  Description
    Returns a list of ids and names of all existing rl-action facts which have the specified robot as value in their ``assigned-to`` slot i.e. all executable actions for a certain robot. Format: "actionid|actionname".
  Specification
    .. code-block:: lisp

        string robot
        ---
        string[] actions

:`set_rl_mode`:
  
  Type
    Service
  Description
    Allows the client to set the mode of the reinforcement learning plugin. Available modes are TRAINING and EXECUTION. If successful, the message "Set mode to (MODE)" is returned, otherwise "Couldn't set mode".
  Specification
    .. code-block:: lisp

        string mode
        ---
        string confirmation

:`get_free_robot`:
  
  Type
    Action Server
  Description
    Calling this action starts a search for a robot which is currently not working on an action and thus waiting. When a free robot has been found, its name is returned. During the search, feedback may be returned stating that no free robot has been found and the search is continued.
  Specification
    .. code-block:: lisp

        ---
        string robot
        ---
        string feedback

:`action_selection`:
  
  Type
    Action Server
  Description
    Calling this action with a valid actionid starts the action selection process in CLIPS. In the matching rl-action fact, the ``is-selected`` flag gets set, signaling to the user generated agent which action has been selected. When the execution of the action has been finished, the user must set the ``is-finished`` flag which leads to the actionid, the earned reward and an info-string are returned. This string is currently only used to signal if an episode has finished in which case it says "Done" otherwise it is empty. 
  Specification
    .. code-block:: lisp

        string actionid
        ---
        string actionid
        int32 reward
        string info
        ---
        string feedback

:`reset_cx`:
  
  Type
    Action Server
  Description
    Calling this action starts a reset procedure for the environment. The reset is done by loading the fact base at an initial state. After this reset, a string is returned confirming the successful reset ("Reset completed").
  Specification
    .. code-block:: lisp

        ---
        string confirmation
        ---
        string feedback

:`exec_action_selection`:
  
  Type
    Client
  Description
    This client is used if the reinforcement learning plugin is in EXECUTION mode. When an action selection is needed (i.e. there are executable actions and robots without a task), the client sends a request to a service implemented by the user. This request consists of the current state string (as specified in **_create_rl_env_state_**) and a list of executable action (as specified in **_get_action_list_**). Using this information a trained RL agent should be able to predict the next action which then must be returned to the client via its actionid.
  Specification
    .. code-block:: lisp

        string state
        string[] actions
        ---
        string actionid
