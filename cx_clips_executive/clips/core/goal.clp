	"Goal specification.
   A goal is the top-most entity to structure the flow of execution. It
   follows a goal lifecycle indicated by the mode of the goal.

   There are two types of goals:
   ACHIEVE:  a certain target condition is to be achieved through the
             generation and execution of a (possibly ordered) set of actions.
   MAINTAIN: a certain condition is to be maintained during the existence
             of the goal. This may be used for monitoring (the goal fails if
             the condition no longer holds) or for active maintenance
             (sub-goals may be generated to re-achieve the condition).

   The goal lifecycle roughly has the following stages:
   - FORMULATED
     The goal has just come into existence and is to be considered.
   - SELECTED
     The goal has been selected for expansion, that is, a set of actions
     (possibly a sequence or a temporal network) is to be generated
     (for example using a planner, or through a static plan) that
     intends to achieve the given goal.
   - EXPANDED
     The goal has been expanded, that is, there exists at least one plan
     intended to achieve the desired goal, or the respective sub-goals
     have been formulated.
   - COMMITTED
     The goal and (one of) its plan(s) is intended to be executed to achieve
     the respective goal. Committing may require to obtain specific resources
     indicated by the plan.
   - DISPATCHED
     An execution mechanism has started to execute the plan associated with
     the goal, for example issuing action commands.
   - FINISHED
     The goal has finished, meaning that no further actions of plans
     belonging to this goal will be executed. The outcome field indicates
     whether the goal was completed, rejected, or has failed.
   - EVALUATED
     After a goal has finished, the goal reasoner evaluates the impact of
     the (succeeded, rejected, or failed) goal on its own belief.
     This deviates from the goal lifecycle by Roberts et al in that it is
     not only relevant during failure, but always after finishing a goal.
   - RETRACTED
     After the goal has been evaluated, some cleanup (e.g., releasing acquired
     resources) may be necessary before the goal can be destroyed. Once all
     cleanup has been completed, the goal can be retracted. A retracted goal
     is being cleaned up and scheduled for destruction, no further operations
     are allowed on the goal.

   Once a goal reached the FINISHED mode the outcome determines whether it
   was successful or failed:
   - COMPLETED
     The goal been achieved and plan execution finished successfully.
   - FAILED
     The goal has failed and can no longer be pursued unless being reset.
   - REJECTED
     The goal reasoner deemed this goal not to be feasible or desirable
     (any more). A goal may only be rejected from the FORMULATED, SELECTED,
     or EXPANDED mode. Once we have COMMITTED to a goal it can only be stopped
     by completion or failure.
   - UNKNOWN
     The goal has not reached its FINISHED mode, yet.

   A goal has a unique ID (which must be globally unique among all goals). It
   may be associated to a specific class of goals. That is, there may be
   multiple instances of a certain class of goals, but these must have
   different IDs. A goal ID may appear only once during the lifetime of the
   executive. The class allows users to implement the specific handling for
   specific kinds of goals of that very class, and thus to match these goals
   in goal reasoning rules' antecendents.

   A goal may have a parent goal. This allows for the creation of goal
   hierarchies and sub-goals can contribute to the completion or failure
   of the parent goal. A goal shall fail if any of its sub-goals fails.
   If an ACHIEVE goal has any sub-goals, it shall be COMPLETED once all of
   its sub-goals have been COMPLETED. MAINTAIN goals shall fail if a sub-goal
   fails, but stay COMMITTED or DISPATCHED if a sub-goal is COMPLETED.

   Goals can contain an informative message. This message is intended to
   explain the goal mode to the user. For example, when a goal is REJECTED
   it should state the reason for rejection.

	; The sub-type of a goal describes the inherent behavior of a
	; goal. It is used to specify well-known goals with specific
	; semantics, for example to run all sub-goals or retry a given
	; sub-goal. The default sub-type is nil and means an entirely
	; user-specificed goal, i.e., the user takes control of all stages
	; in the goal life-cycle.
	(slot sub-type (type SYMBOL))

	; To form goal trees, a parent goal can be specified to which this
	; goal belongs. Unless a well-known sub-goal sub-type (e.g.,
	; RUN-ALL-OF-SUBGOALS, TRY-ALL-OF-SUBGOALS, or RETRY-SUBGOAL) is
	; used for the parent goal, the user must take take care of all
	; stages of the lifecycle.
	(slot parent (type SYMBOL))

	; The outcome of a goal is initially UNKNOWN, and at the latest when
	; entering the FINISHED mode must be determined to be either
	; successfully COMPLETED, or FAILED. A goal may be REJECTED before
	; it is in COMMITTED mode. The general distinction is that goals can
	; be REJECTED while they have not started execution, i.e., before
	; they are enter the COMITTED mode, and may only complete or fail
	; afterwards.

	; In case of a disturbance, give machine-readable information.
	; This field may contain a number of disturbances and are meant to
	; inform, e.g., the goal reasoner or some execution monitoring entity,
	; possibly to take corrective action or even abort a goal.
	; Warnings MUST always start with a symbol identifying the warning,
	; e.g., ACTION-OVERTIME, and may be followed by an arbitrary number
	; of additional values specifying the warning closer, e.g., to
	; indicate that a move operation took too long, the warning could
	; be (ACTION-OVERTIME 20 move), to indicate that the action with
	; the ID 20 in the committed plan using the operator `move` took
	; too long. A warning may appear more than once, e.g., to indicate
	; multiple overtime situations in the executed plan.
	; The intention is to easily allow for the occurrence of any
	; warning of a specified type, but also to acquire more information
	; by components which are able to handle a *specific* warning.
	; This means that we do not strive for a generic warning processing
	; (other than "there is any warning") and therefore we do not introduce
	; a separator in-between warnings.
	(multislot warning)

	; In case of an error, give machine-readable information about the
	; error. The first entry in the field MUST be a symbol identifying
	; the general reason of the error, e.g., SKILL-FAILED. The intention
	; of the field is to allow for error handling and recovery.

	; A human-readable message describing an error. This message is
	; passed on to frontends and displayed to the user.

	; higher number entails higher priority
	; A goal might be preferred for selection, expansion, or execution depending
	; on its priority. Some spec chains may support this, others not.
	(slot priority (type FLOAT) (default 0.0))
	; Parameters that a goal reasoner or expander might need to evaluate goal.
	; It is recommended to use a rich descriptive structure similar to wm-fact
	; keys. Examples:
	; - (params order O1 robot R1)
	; - (params machine RS1 robots [ R1 R2 ])
	; - (params text "Remember the Cant")
	; - (params location { x 0.0 y 1.0 })
	(multislot params)

	; Goal meta data allows the goal reasoner to store arbitrary
	; information that is necessary to handle the proper operation of
	; the goal and that is not passed as a parameter. For example, it
	; could contain the number of tries performed for a goal.
	(multislot meta)

	; Resource handling for the given goal.  A goal may list a number of
	; required resources. The resources can be of different types and
	; specific handlers need to take care of acquiring these
	; resources. Acquisition generally happens once committed to a
	; goal. A goal may only enter the DISPATCHED mode if the required
	; resources are a subset of the acquired resources. Once a goal has
	; been RETRACTED the resources must be deallocated again by the
	; handlers. Only when the acquired resources are empty is a goal
	; completed removed. For sub-goal types, parent goals shall not
	; advance beyond a goal until all resources for a goal have been
	; deallocated. The automatic cleanup waits for all resources to be
	; deallocated.
